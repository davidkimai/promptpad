# 🎭 The Art of Remixing: From Good to Viral

## What Makes a Great Remix?

The best remixes don't just copy—they transform. Like TikTok dances that evolve with each creator, great prompt remixes add a layer of innovation.

## The Remix Formula

```
Original Strength + Your Unique Angle + Community Need = Viral Remix
```

## Step-by-Step Remix Guide

### 1. Find Your Base
Look for prompts with:
- High usage but room for improvement
- Good structure but narrow application  
- Strong concept but weak execution

### 2. Identify the Gap
Ask yourself:
- What's missing for my use case?
- What would make this 10x better?
- What constraint would create magic?

### 3. Make Your Move

#### The Specializer
```yaml
# Original: Generic writing assistant
template: "Write about {topic}"

# Your Remix: SaaS Blog Specialist
template: |
  Write a SaaS blog post about {topic}.
  Include: {pain_point}, {solution}, {case_study}
  CTA: {conversion_goal}
  SEO keywords: {keywords}
```

#### The Constrainer  
```yaml
# Original: Idea generator
template: "Generate ideas for {domain}"

# Your Remix: 10-Second Pitch Generator
template: |
  Generate ideas for {domain}.
  Constraint: Must be explainable in 10 seconds
  Format: "{Problem} solved by {solution} for {market}"
```

#### The Chainer
```yaml
# Original: Single-step process
template: "Analyze {data}"

# Your Remix: Three-step deep dive
chain:
  - step: "First, identify patterns in {data}"
  - step: "Then, find anomalies"  
  - step: "Finally, recommend actions"
```

## Remix Etiquette

### Always:
- Credit the original creator
- Share improvements back
- Document what you changed
- Maintain quality standards

### Never:
- Copy without attribution
- Make trivial changes for credit
- Break working functionality
- Ignore community feedback

## Advanced Remix Techniques

### 1. The Merger
Combine two successful prompts:
```yaml
name: "Code + Docs Generator"
parents: ["code-writer", "doc-creator"]
template: |
  Write {function_type} that {purpose}
  Then create {doc_style} documentation
  Include: examples, edge cases, performance notes
```

### 2. The Inverse
Flip the prompt's purpose:
```yaml
# Original: Find bugs in code
# Remix: Inject subtle bugs for training
template: |
  Take this {code} and introduce {num_bugs} subtle bugs
  Make them realistic but findable
  Document each bug's location separately
```

### 3. The Localizer
Adapt for specific markets:
```yaml
# Original: English customer support
# Remix: Japanese business communication
template: |
  Respond to {inquiry} using Japanese business etiquette
  Keigo level: {formality}
  Include appropriate seasonal greetings
```
